Cool app for trading stocks and indices.
Enjoy!! 
Bugs - returning client and fetchData func from useAggregateQuery func
     - having to pass useAggregateQuery attributes each time when accessing returned attributes

Typescript object literal type safety - removed onError property 

Error 403 - forbidden. Possibly - API rate limit, server misconfiguration, API key /auth issue 

writing test for API endpoint
